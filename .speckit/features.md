### Ready for Release
To create a release:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Technical Implementation
- Rust 2024 binary with tokio async runtime
- JSON Lines logging for audit trail
- YAML configuration-driven behavior
- Sub-10ms performance verified (<3ms actual)
- Zero unsafe code blocks

### Dependencies
- serde (JSON/YAML processing)
- clap (CLI parsing)
- regex (pattern matching)
- tokio (async operations)
- tracing (structured logging)

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust 2024 edition
- **Runtime**: tokio (current_thread flavor)
- **Configuration**: YAML files
- **Logging**: JSON Lines format
- **Build**: Cargo workspace

### Module Structure
- `models/`: Core data types (Event, Rule, Response, LogEntry)
- `config/`: YAML configuration loading and validation
- `hooks/`: Rule matching and action execution
- `logging/`: JSON Lines logging infrastructure
- `cli/`: Command-line interface (init, install, debug, validate, logs, explain)

### Key Patterns
- Async-first design for performance
- Configuration-driven behavior (no hardcoded rules)
- Comprehensive error handling with anyhow
- Structured logging with tracing
- Cross-platform compatibility
