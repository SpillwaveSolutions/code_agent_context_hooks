# AGENTS.md

**NOTE:** All project specifications, implementation plans, and feature tracking are now consolidated in the `.speckit/` directory. The legacy `specs/` and `.specify/` directories have been removed.

## Git Workflow Requirements

**CRITICAL: Always use feature branches for all work.**

- **NEVER commit directly to `main`** - All feature work MUST be done in a feature branch
- Create a feature branch before starting any work: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`
- Push the feature branch and create a Pull Request for review
- Only merge to `main` via PR after review

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- Features: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/add-debug-command`)
- Bugfixes: `fix/<bug-description>` (e.g., `fix/config-parsing-error`)
- Documentation: `docs/<doc-topic>` (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)

**Workflow:**
1. `git checkout -b feature/<name>` - Create feature branch
2. Make changes and commit with conventional commit messages
3. **Run all checks before committing** (see Pre-Commit Checks below)
4. `git push -u origin feature/<name>` - Push to remote
5. Create PR via `gh pr create` or GitHub UI
6. Merge after review

**Pre-Commit Checks (MANDATORY):**
Before every commit, run these checks locally to avoid CI failures:
```bash
cd cch_cli
cargo fmt --check        # Check formatting
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # Linting
cargo test               # All tests must pass
```

Or run all checks with:
```bash
cd cch_cli && cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

**NEVER commit if any of these checks fail.** Fix all issues first.
